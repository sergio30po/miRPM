\title{Individual miRNA plot for differentially expressed miRNAs}
\usage{
individual_miRNA_plot(
  filtered_results,
  rpm_matrix,
  metadata,
  condition_column,
  sample_column,
  groups_to_include,
  condition_colors,
  adjusted_pvalue_column,
  output_dir = "Individual_plots"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_results}{Data frame with the filtered results (FDR < 0.05). The first column should contain miRNA names.}

\item{rpm_matrix}{Matrix of RPMs (miRNAs in rows, samples in columns).}

\item{metadata}{Data frame with sample group information. Must have a column for sample names and another for groups.}

\item{condition_column}{Name of the column in `metadata` that contains the groups.}

\item{sample_column}{Name of the column in `metadata` that contains the sample names.}

\item{groups_to_include}{Vector with the names of the groups to include in the comparison.}

\item{condition_colors}{Named vector of colors for each condition. The names should match the groups in `groups_to_include`.}

\item{adjusted_pvalue_column}{Name of the column in `filtered_results` that contains the adjusted p-value.}

\item{output_dir}{Name of the main folder where the plots will be saved (default: "Individual_plots").}
}
\value{
No return value. The plots are saved as PNG files in the specified folder structure.
}
\description{
This function generates dot plots for differentially expressed miRNAs between specific groups.
The plots are saved as PNG files in a folder named after the comparison, inside a main folder called "Individual_plots".
