\title{Normalize a count matrix to RPM without scientific notation}
\usage{
normalize_rpm(count_matrix, metrics, reads_column)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_matrix}{A count matrix (genes in rows, samples in columns).}

\item{metrics}{A dataframe containing sample information, including total reads.}

\item{reads_column}{The name of the column in metrics that contains the total reads.}
}
\value{
A normalized matrix in RPM without scientific notation.
}
\description{
This function normalizes a count matrix to Reads Per Million (RPM) using the total reads per sample.
The resulting matrix is rounded to 2 decimal places and avoids scientific notation.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# count_matrix <- matrix(c(100, 200, 300, 400), nrow = 2, dimnames = list(c("Gene1", "Gene2"), c("Sample1", "Sample2")))
# metrics <- data.frame(Sample = c("Sample1", "Sample2"), TotalReads = c(1000, 2000))
# rpm_matrix <- normalize_rpm(count_matrix, metrics, "TotalReads")
}
